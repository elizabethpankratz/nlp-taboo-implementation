    "The descriptive sentence will be accepted into the cleaning step (where we will make sure that no tws or the mw were used and if so, we'll replace them) if it contains at least two of the input words, besides the seeds. As long as the sentence is not accepted, we will keep generating.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help reach a high score: once an input word has been used and its score_vector value increases, we will leave that segment in our sentence. Not sure if this hurts more than it helps, but adding the input word as a seed is VERY complicated. And not sure it would make sense either.\n",

    "It would be useful to generate a list of synonyms of all input words to expand the input_words set and have higher acceptance rate. We thought about cleaning the input words set from the start but those are words with high probability of occurence so we better leave them and clean in the end.\n",
