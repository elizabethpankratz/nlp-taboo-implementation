http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequence-medieval	After all , these are very different concepts : a conditional is a sentence , which can be true or false ; an argument or inference is an act , a consecution of assertions , which can be valid or invalid ;	a consequence is a	relation between sentential / propositional entities , which can hold or fail to hold ( Sundholm 1998 ) .

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequence-medieval	When it is said that "	an animal is a	substance ; therefore a man is a substance " is a good consequence I reply that this consequence does not hold in virtue of form ( ratione formae ) , but rather in virtue of matter .
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequence-medieval	What characterizes them as	a group is the	definition of formal consequence based on the substitutivity criterion , in the spirit of ( ST ) ( more on this below ) .

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequence-medieval	" This is noticeable not only in the definitions of formal ( as opposed to material ) consequence , but also in the very definitions of consequence which begin to mention mental acts , such as : "	a consequence is a	derivation ( illatio ) of the consequent from the antecedent " ( Strode , quoted in Normore 1993 , 449 ) .
