This repository contains our final project for the course BM1 Advanced Natural Language Processing at the Universität Potsdam in the winter semester 2019/2020: an implementation of the game Taboo.

In Taboo, a player draws a card that shows one main word (MW) and five related “taboo” words (TWs), and the player’s task is to describe the MW without using any of the TWs. For example, given the MW “sweet”, TWs might include “sugary”, “tea”, “nice”, “sour”, and “sixteen”, and these must all be avoided in the description of “sweet”. Each team gains points based on how many MWs the team members can successfully guess within a set length of time. Our implementation will consist of two components of the gameplay: a Taboo card generator and a Taboo player.
