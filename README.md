# Taboo Implementation

A Taboo-style card generator, using pre-trained word2vec embeddings and semantic relations from WordNet, and a Taboo player text generator, implemented with GRUs using PyTorch.

## How to use

To run this project, you need Python 3 and the libraries x, y, and z.
Also, you should download the pre-trained word2vec embeddings from here (link).
(These are not included in the repository because of size.)

Begin by cloning this repository.

```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/epankratz/nlp-taboo-implementation
```

### Taboo card generator

Move big word vector file in x folder.

Now, from your command line:

```
# comment
abc 

# comment
jkl
```

For a commentated illustration of the card generator, see `dir/xyz-llustration.ipynb`.
For more detail about the card generator's development, see `dir/xyz-walkthrough.ipynb`.
